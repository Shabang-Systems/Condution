Condution is a powerful yet incredibly simple check-list application that supports your needs from study, to business, and to life. Bring Condution with you across the globe and let it be your second brain — so you can focus on living your best life.

## Your Favorite Task-List
Create tasks, manage them in projects, add some tags, set due dates, and repeat them at will. Condution has the whole nine-yards of the core list-making features nailed so you could create and edit anything from grocery lists to hundred-task projects.

## Filters and Perspectives
Filter tasks by tag? Check. Filter by projects? Check. Filter by due date? Check. Filter by due date and project with tags and sort tasks based on defer date while hiding everything that's not available? You bet.

## Collaborative Workspaces
create and share "workspaces" by tapping on the "personal workspace" badge found on the upcoming view. These workspaces are collaborative Condution views in which everyone — regardless if they have an account — could collaborate on Condution!

## Tag Weights
Tags are weighted! You could now set a tag to be more "heavy" than others (say.. High Energy with a weight of 10, Low Energy with a weight of 0.5), and these weight values will reflect across various parts of the interface (including a "loading bar" on projects) to give you an intuitive view of how "hard" something will be.

## Due + Start Dates (and Times!)
Yes, you heard it right! Unlike some of the other apps out there, we know that timing is important to people! Every task is hidden until a certain *time* and due at precisely at a *time*, so your know day could be managed right down to your needs.

## Sequential and Parallel Projects!
Some tasks can't really be done without others before it being done first, and we understand that. Tasks blocked in a sequential project could be hidden if needed, and shown again when ready.

## Open-Source
Although Condution provides you with a database to sync your tasks, the project itself is open-source! Anyone could contribute to the project, and everyone could use it for absolutely free. Forever.
