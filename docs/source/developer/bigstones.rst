A Boring Chapter of Concepts
============================
.. note:: If this is your first time here, **don't glance over this**. Read the next section out loud to your pet duck to ensure understanding!

Condution's API follows an `Event Based <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming>`_ programming paradigm. We make heavy use of the `Async/Await syntax <https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/future-javascript/async-await>`_ of TypeScript in order to create fast and responsive hooks into live-editing enviroments. (Remember, :doc:`../guides/workspaces` exist!) So, if you don't know what those are, read the linked resources.

If you don't know how Condution (the app) works, please `try it <https://app.condution.com/>`_. Condution's API is much easier to explain after you know how the app itself works.

Ok. I am going to assume that you tried it, and now know basic concepts.

To start working with the Condution API, you need a :doc:`context`.
