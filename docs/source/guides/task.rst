Anatomy of a Task
*****************



Tasks are the center of every productivity app which is why they're so crucial to understand. In this guide, we'll walk you through the different ways to add and interact with tasks.

Adding a task
-------------

There are two ways to make a task. If you're inside a project, you can simply press the add a task button. However, if in the moment simply want to add a task to your inbox for later sorting, you can use our FAB (Floating Action Button) as seen below.

To make your life even easier, our FAB includes natural language support. This means you can simply say things like "Wash the car from 8 to 9 on Sunday" and it'll add a task with the deffer date of Sunday at 8 and due date of Sunday at 9.

Inside a task
-------------

Inside of the task there are quite a few elements as can be seen in the below diagram.

The Delete Button
+++++++++++++++++

The Delete button deletes a task... yeah that's about it.

The Flag Button
+++++++++++++++

When pressed, the flag button flags a task.

Flagged tasks can be filtered using perspective filters. A brief tutorial on how to use perspective filters is `available here`_.

The Globe Button
++++++++++++++++

The globe button toggles between floating and fixed timezones.

Let's say for example you needed to call your mother at 8pm every Friday and one day you happen to travel to Japan. If you had fixed timezones enabled (the default), when you arrive, calling your mother would appear due 8pm plus the time difference between wherever you live and Japan.

However, say for example you want to do Yoga between 5-6pm as well, but you wanted to do it at 5-6pm wherever you are, you can used Floating Timezones.

The Repeat Button
+++++++++++++++++

Using the repeat button on a task allows you to set a task to repeat.

Clicking it will reveal a modal that will allow you to choose whether or not you want your task to repeat on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. Choosing either daily, or monthly will also create an arrow in the bottom right.

Clicking this arrow will reveal an option to choose what days in the week, or days in a month you would like your task to repeat.

Checking a repeating task off will cause it to re-appear due whenever you have set it to be next due.
The Tags Pane Button
++++++++++++++++++++

Clicking the tags pane button will reveal the tags pane.

The tags pane allows you to modify tags. A guide on how to use tags and the tags pane can be `seen here`_.

The Deferred Date Box
+++++++++++++++++++++

The deferred date box allows you to set a deffer date for a task.

A deffer date is the date by which you want to/are able to start a task. When a task is deferred, Condution treats it as something you aren't able to complete. You can still check them off, but they will appear grey in color and won't appear in upcoming until the deffer date has passed and they are no longer deferred. There are other ways a task might become deferred such as in `sequential projects`_, but for the most part this is done via a deffer date.

An example of when you might want to use a defer date is say for example you need to visit your neighbor to ask about the strange and at times disturbing screams coming from their basement no one else in your neighborhood is brave enough to confront them about. However, you happen to be in Japan. You might defer that task until you return.

Another example might be if you're home, but too busy working on documentation for a productivity application for the next few days to bother yourself with investigating the screams. You might want to defer it until you feel it is more convenient.

Like the FAB box, the Deferred Date Box also supports natural language processing so you can type natural phrases such as "Tomorrow at 2pm". Just make sure to do so in the text field within the calendar view.

The Due Date Box
++++++++++++++++

The due date box allows you to set a due date for a task

Due dates are quite fundemental to the Condution workflow. Setting a due date specifies when a task is due dictating it's placement on the calendar, how it's filtereda and sorted in perspectives, and when it appears in upcoming.

Much like with deffer dates, the due date box supports natural langauge processing.

The Projects Assigner
+++++++++++++++++++++

The projects assigner simply takes a task and places it where you specify within it's dropdown.

The Tags Adder
++++++++++++++

The tags adder simply allows you to asign and create tags.

To create a tag, simply type the name of the tag you would like and press enter. To assign a tag, simply type the name of the tag you wish to assign and press enter.
