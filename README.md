**This. Is. Condution.** A personal project management system that makes sense and will not burn your pockets out.

## Those Download Buttons?
👉 [**Direct Download**](https://condution.shabang.cf/#downloads) the latest version of Condution here! 👈 

Also, here's the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/condution/id1523249900) & [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cf.shabang.condution) links for y'all phone nerds out there.

## The App
Condution is a wonderful electron app built to create a perfectly easy task-management dashboard that's powerful, yet also simple. The inspiration of the project spanned from our long frustration with the current state of productivity software on the internet — they are expensive and often complicated to use.

Condution attempts to change this. We want to create an open-source productivity/task-management app that is both simple, and, well, free (but we do take [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/condution) donations though).

### Features 
#### The Standard Spiel
Create tasks, manage them in projects, add some tags, set due dates, and repeat them at will. Condution has the whole nine-yards of the core list-making features nailed so you could create and edit anything from grocery lists to hundred-task projects.

#### Due + Start Dates (and Times!)
Yes, you heard it right! Unlike some of the other apps out there, we know that timing is important to people! Every task is hidden until a certain *time* and due at precisely at a *time*, so your day can be managed right down to your needs.

#### Sequential and Parallel Projects!
Some tasks can't really be done without others before it being done first, and we understand that. Tasks blocked in a sequential project could be hidden if needed, and shown again when ready.

#### Filters and Perspectives
Filter tasks by tag? Check. Filter by projects? Check. Filter by due date? Check. Filter by due date and project with tags and sort tasks based on defer date while hiding eveything that's not avaliable? You bet.

## The Team
We are Shabang, a software development company aiming to design innovative solutions for interesting issues with fun and creative products.

## Building
*Given that you are a codey child, you should be able to figure it out ;)*

Just kidding, we will add instructions for Firebase connection, buliding, and compiling soon.
