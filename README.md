# #!/Shabang | Condution(Engine)
**This. Is. Condution('s API).** A personal project management system (toolkit) that makes sense and will not burn your pockets out.

## What the heck?
We are Shabang, a software development company aiming to design innovative solutions for clients and create fun projects and creative products.

We happen to also be a group of students from the silicon valley wanting to make this world slightly better with technology.


## Why the heck?
It is important that products like task management software should not be prohibitively expensive for students, nor should they be so bare-bones that they are no better than a list. Condution is created to serve both of those needs. 


## When the heck?
This project is being developed in our spare times, sowe don't really have a formal timeline for this. However, if we must give one, expect a working demo very soon, and a first launch sometimes in June. Stay tuned!

## How the heck?
We love contributions! You are welcome to contribute, just keep in mind that we prefer 4 spaces over tabs.

## Thank you!
Thank you for supporting us on this project. We really hope that this will be something useful. (At least when we are done with it.)
